Nanahan is a data structure library intent to low latency.

You can **buy** bandwidth but not latency.
You can bribe Intel but not **God** (speed of light).

Map
===
A implementation of Hopscotch hashing for single thread.
Usage is similar to boost/std::tr1 unordered\_map.
Let me know if you want some methods implemented in unordered\_map.
It finds data **faster** than any other unordered\_map.
